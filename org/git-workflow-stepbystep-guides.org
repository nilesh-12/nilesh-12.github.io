* Workflows
** Deployment for UAT Environment

Feature branch has been merged/reviewed into develop branch through the github Pull Request

for UAT deployment the current develop branch will be merged into uat branch

1. Create a release branch to start a deployment cylce

   1.1. Pull changes
   #+begin_src
     git pull upstream develop
   #+end_src

   1.2. Checkout to uat branch
   #+begin_src
     git checkout develop
   #+end_src

   1.3. Checkout to the newly created branch
   #+begin_src
   git checkout -b release/<yyyy-mm-dd>
   #+end_src

2. Release-oriented tasks

   2.1. Building the source code
   #+begin_src
     npm run build
   #+end_src
   Above command is configured to create an optimized build of the source to be deployment on the cloud server.

   2.2. Bug fixes
   #+begin_src
     git add .
     git commit -m "fix some bugs"
   #+end_src

   2.3. Documentation generation
   #+begin_src
     vi path/to/feature/folder/README.md
   #+end_src
   You can add all the details about the code and it's working. All the functions, their parameters, and output You should example code blocks to show the intended usage. You can add warning and any known issues. This documentation is important for the next developer to continue where you left off.

3. Once it's ready to ship, the release branch gets merged into uat and tagged with a version number.

    3.1. We create a tag with date (UAT should not have version and date of deployment should work)
    #+begin_src
      git tag release/<yyyy-mm-dd>
      git push --tags upstream
    #+end_src

    #+begin_quote
    Once the release is ready to ship, it will get merged it into main and develop, then the release branch will be deleted. Itâ€™s important to merge back into develop because critical updates may have been added to the release branch and they need to be accessible to new features. If your organization stresses code review, this would be an ideal place for a pull request.
    #+end_quote

    3.2. In addition, it should be merged back into develop, which may have progressed since the release was initiated.
    #+begin_src
      git checkout uat
      git merge release/<yyyy-mm-dd>
    #+end_src
